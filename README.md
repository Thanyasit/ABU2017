# Control Robot with Joystick using PIC16F877
<h2>Description</h2>
This is a code for a robot with four-wheel control using a joystick and PIC16F877 microcontroller.

The code includes functions for controlling the robot's movements in different directions, speed, angle, lift, and shooting. The robot also has a sensor for detecting magazine, and there is a function for delaying the robot if the magazine is detected for ABU Robot Contest Thailand Championship 2017.
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
The following hardware is required to run this code:<br><br>

- PIC16F877 Microcontroller<br>
- Joystick<br>
- Four-wheel robot<br>
- Magazine sensor<br>
<h2>Usage</h2>
To use this code, you need to upload it to the PIC16F877 microcontroller. The code is written in C language and can be compiled and uploaded using MPLAB X IDE.
