# Control Robot with Joystick using PIC16F877
<h2>Description</h2>
This is a code for a robot with four-wheel control using a joystick and PIC16F877 microcontroller.

The code includes functions for controlling the robot's movements in different directions, speed, angle, lift, and shooting. The robot also has a sensor for detecting magazine, and there is a function for delaying the robot if the magazine is detected for ABU Robot Contest Thailand Championship 2017.
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
The following hardware is required to run this code:<br><br>

- PIC16F877 Microcontroller<br>
- Joystick<br>
- Four-wheel robot<br>
- Magazine sensor<br>
<h2>Usage</h2>
To use this code, you need to upload it to the PIC16F877 microcontroller. The code is written in C language and can be compiled and uploaded using MPLAB X IDE.

The robot is controlled using a joystick. The following keys control the robot's movements:<br><br>

- A: Move forward<br>
- B: Move backward<br>
- C: Move left<br>
- D: Move right<br>
- H: Roll right<br>
- G: Roll left<br>
- K: Shoot<br>
- I: Magazine<br>
- L: Increase speed of the roll and shoot<br>
- J: Decrease speed of the roll and shoot<br>
- E: Lift up<br>
- F: Lift down<br>
- M: Angle up<br>
- N: Angle down<br>
